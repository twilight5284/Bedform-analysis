%% surface and profile filter
%
% INPUTS:
%     z, surface matrix;
%     L, wavelength of interest;
%     d, different filters; 
%        1 - exponential smoothing with a window of 0.75*L;
%        2 - moving average smoothing with a window of 3*L in the direction of rows;
%        3 - moving average smoothing with a window of 3*L in the direction of columns;

% OUTPUTS:
%     z0, surface matrix after filtering
